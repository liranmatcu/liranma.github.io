I am a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Texas Christian University. My current research interests cover the security and reliability of networked information systems (such as Wi-Fi networks, cognitive radio networks, vehicular networks, sensor networks, social networks, and cloud services), and algorithms and protocols for smartphone based systems and applications (such as smart health and care), Internet of Things (IoT), <a href="https://ai.tcu.edu/" target="_blank"> artificial intelligence </a> and <a href="https://eurekalabs.net/" target="_blank">cybersecurity education</a> (in part supported by NSF). It involves building prototype systems, and conducting real experiments and measurements.
